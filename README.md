# Spot_Quantifier
An R script for quantifying "Spot Assays", in which rectangular plates are pinned with media of different concentrations in a rectangular grid. Quantifies bacterial growth as the proportion of a grid-space rectangle covered by bacterial colonies (as a number between 0 and 1).
Input is a user-selected folder containing "```.JPG```" images of plates. For each plate, ```Spot_QuantLoop.R``` outputs the proportions all grid-spaces as an Excel-compatible "```.csv```" file, and plots showing the grid fitted and the thresholded colonies for each grid-space as "```.jpeg```" files, and  contours across the plate as "```.png```" files.
